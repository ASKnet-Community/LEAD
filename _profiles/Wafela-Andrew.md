Hello world! Call me Andrew ,Ugandan by nationality aged 34,an open source technician,earger to learn new methodologies in tech.people call me in
my home town "*DOCTOR DEVICE*",I started my tech 20 years ago but I was all along doing my things offline without documentation.It was in 2019,when I came across Mr vuga William ,the executive director of The **Youth Empowerment Foundation** **(YEF)** who introduced me to the **ASKotec** and we carried some innovations like building led light by Mr Maliamungu Richard of rhino camp,it was so interesting as i was already familiar with materials like transistors,resistor,capacitors ,diodes etc.A big boom was in late 2019 when we had a very big **community repair cafe** in adjumani at ruyo guest house ,here I was able to meet experts in opentech from Sudan,Kenya and Berlin germany,led by **Mr timm wille** who so interesting and inspiring.

Here was my time to know *ASKnet* and later got alink to *trackII 2020/2021* where we collaborated on a lot of projects and *github documentation*. the online collaboration offered by *ASKnet* has helped me a great deal because now am able to collaborate on any issue with distant people and am also able to publish my work for views by other experts.Not only that,through *ASKnet* I had an opportunity to learn *podcasting and audio editing* by *Mr Romeo ronald* of *platform africa*,so as per now i can record my voice and do editing using an *open source software audacity*.My contuinity with *ASKnet* is going to make me a *job maker not a job seeker*.
Conclusively *ASKnet* has come to clear an ending complains of an *employment among youths across the world*.

"*JOIN ASKnet TO BECOME AJOB MAKER NOT A JOB SEEKER*"
