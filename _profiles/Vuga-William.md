Vuga William is my name, am 35 years old. A South Sudanese Male, living in Pagrinya Refugee Settlement in Uganda (adjuamani district). This is my second time of becoming a refugee in Uganda, due to civil war erupted back home in 2013 and 2016 in the country South Sudan. This has negatively affected my youthful life time.

As life keeps pressing harder as Technology has change everything! i started creating peer to peer with my friends through workshop, and working on the Defyhatenow (Hate speech Mitigation and counteract online and offline hate speech), THAT was the pave way for me to organised a lots of meetup and workshop for my community later on founded YEF , community innovation Hub that help thousand community both refugee and host to addressed their local problems, YEF has become pool for young people to have access to information and basic learning at the center.
