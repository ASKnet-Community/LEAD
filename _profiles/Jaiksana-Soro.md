An accomplished innovator from South Sudan, Jaiksana Soro was forced to move to a refugee camp in Uganda in 2016 due to armed conflicts. Arriving there, he saw that most of the communities living in refugee camps still have mindsets shaped by the landscape of war based around tribal agendas. This inspired him to found [Platform Africa](https://www.platformafrica.com/), an organization using media, education, and technology to help other young refugees to move towards a more equitable, informed, and resilient society. He has also created initiatives and programs to raise awareness and develop means to mitigate social media-based hate speech and online incitement of violence. In addition to this, he helped develop [#ASKotec](https://openculture.agency/outcomes/askotec/) â€“ a hands-on technical resource and repair kit for community trainers, created for mobile field-use where there is limited access to power and internet connectivity.

Jaiksana writes and produces music among other things, he's an avid advocate for veganism and a sustainable way of living.
