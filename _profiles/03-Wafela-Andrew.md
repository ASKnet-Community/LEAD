Hello world! Call me Andrew ,Ugandan by nationality aged 34,an open source technician,earger to learn new methodologies in tech.people call me in
my home town "DOCTOR DEVICE.



I started my tech 20 years ago but I was all along doing my things offline without documentation.
It was in 2019,when I came across Mr vuga William ,the executive director of youth empowerment foundation (YEF) who introduced me to #ASKotec and we carried some innovations like building led light by Mr Maliamungu Richard of rhino camp,it was so interesting as i was already familiar with materials like transistors,resistor,capacitors ,diodes etc.

A big boom was in late 2019 when we had a very big community repair cafe in adjumani at ruyo guest house ,here I was able to meet experts in open
tech from Sudan,Kenya and Berlin germany,led by Mr timm wille who so interesting and inspiring.

Here was my time to know #ASKnet and later got alink to trackII 2020/2021 where we collaborated on a lot of projects and github documentation. the online collaboration offered by #ASKnet has helped me a great deal because now am able to collaborate on any issue with distant people and am also able to publish my work for views by other experts.
Not only that,through #ASKnet I had an opportunity to learn podcasting and audio editing by Mr Romeo ronald of platform africa,so as per now i can record my voice and do editing using an open source software audacity.
My contuinity with #ASKnet is going to make me a job maker not a job seeker.
Conclusively #ASKnet has come to clear an ending complains of an employment among youths across the world.

"JOIN #ASKnet TO BECOME AJOB MAKER NOT A JOB SEEKER"
