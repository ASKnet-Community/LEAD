Lumori Clement is a 28 years old South Sudanese refugee in Rhino Camp refugee resettlement and a co-founder of Save Young Lives Foundation Uganda (SYLFU), attended diploma in computer science and IT. His accomplishment would be to use ICT as an alternative to create peaceful co-existence amongst communities.
"Teaching children a sudden call career path.” He became a refugee in Uganda 2016 while pursing his diploma in computer science and IT but this later changed and he started his first job as a nursery teacher and a youth leader in the community. “his wish was to teach the youths computers skills.” He was able to learn deeper about children and their holistic development, leadership and management skills. This later all changed as his second job was to train youth digital literacy skills, he was happy because it’s a chance once again to further my career in computer science and IT. Using information and technology can initiate peaceful co-existence especially among youth because it’s very concentrative and enabling them to stay away from troubling situations that lead to conflicts in communities.
