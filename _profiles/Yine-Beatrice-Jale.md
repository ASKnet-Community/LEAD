I am a South Sudanese woman, who has been faced by a couple of challenges in the war and before it, I have used those challenges to empower solutions that have created a life for me and many other women, by our formation of GOGirls ICT initiative some of those tech-related challenges where among the most minimized in the country yet they could produce yields like confidence building, self-realization, and self-awareness which are key ingredients for anyone to have to make a life decision

I am happy I am part of a community #ASKnet that believes in my dream of creating a safe space for the girl child to be empowered and self-reliant.
