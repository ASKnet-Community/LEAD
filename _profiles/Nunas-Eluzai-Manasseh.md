Am Nunas Eluzai Manasseh, a South sudanese by Nationality, I was born in Khartoum Sudan, i have grew up there with my parents, i begun my Education journey there, when am In senior three my family decided to relocate to Juba south Sudan this was after the independent of our country 2011, I finished my secondary here in Juba. 

In late 2015 I joined university of Juba school of computer science and information technology department of computer science, it was not my interest but as I have gone deep into it I started to have the School interest, and I have discovered that there's a lot of problem in my country about digital literacy, so I felt It, it's an opportunity to help my community and country as general with the knowledge I have gained at the school. On October 2021 I finally completed my Education journey, bachelor degree in computer science. 

During my education journey I was engaging myself with some hubs and initiatives, through them I have gained a lot of experience, one of the initiatives is Go-girlsICT ICT initiative base in Juba was stablish in 2015 by young south Sudanese women in the field of ICT, through this initiatives I have learnt how to maintain and repair computers, basic knowledge on internet of things. Last year 2020 I have also engaged myself in asknet training which helps me a lot to boost my computer knowledge.
