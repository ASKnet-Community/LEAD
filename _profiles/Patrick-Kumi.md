5 years ago, I left South Sudan due to the civil war that broke out in my home town though I grew up with a single parent. Because of this, I never really knew what it meant to be a kid. Since the adults were quite unsupportive. I didn't learn how to relate well with other kids. While I didn't realize this back then, I had not learned self-awareness until years later.
