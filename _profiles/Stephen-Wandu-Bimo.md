Stephen Wandu Bimo is a South Sudanese humanitarian and the founder and executive director of I CAN SOUTH SUDAN, a non-profit organization that focuses on providing education, healthcare, and other critical services to children and families in South Sudan. Stephen was born and raised in South Sudan and has seen firsthand the challenges faced by his people, particularly the lack of access to basic necessities such as education, healthcare, and clean water.

After completing his education, Stephen decided to dedicate his life to helping others. In 2018, he founded I CAN SOUTH SUDAN, a non-profit organization that aims to improve the lives of children and families in the Refugee Settlement in Uganda and South Sudan by providing them with access to education, healthcare, and other essential services.

Under Stephen's leadership, I CAN SOUTH SUDAN has made significant strides in improving the lives of people in South Sudan. The organization has implemented numerous projects that have had a positive impact on communities across the country. Some of these projects include building schools, providing medical supplies and equipment to hospitals, drilling wells for clean water, and providing vocational training to young people.
