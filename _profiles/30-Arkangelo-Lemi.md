I am a refugee living in the Ocea C Rhino camp refugee settlement, I have been trained and equipped by Platform Africa to survive and live my own life, just before the training I had at Platform Africa, I never had a direction but from the media, repair, and using open source tools like audacity and open GIS tools I now lead a team of audio drama group and mappers in Ocea in creating information for my community.
