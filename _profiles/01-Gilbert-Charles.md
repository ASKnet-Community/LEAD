# GILBERT'S STORY

# Hello Friends,

Call me K. Gilbert Charles, a young South Sudanese born on 30th November 1998 in a small Refugee Settlement called Robidire in Adjumani District. I am the only child to Mr. Moi Alex and Mrs. Gale Jennifer though I have some half siblings from both parents. In my early childhood stages, life was mysterious cause everything seemed strange to my sight as being a stubborn young South Sudanese with big dreams in a foreign land. All I ever thought was I can have anything I ever wanted , but as time went on, things became complicated to the extend I almost lost my path but then on one faithful day, when I first tapped on a computer keyboard in 2010, I felt this is the beginning of the solutions to my problems.

Education wise, I started my primary education from Robidire Refugee Settlement and later during repatriation, moved back to South Sudan and then secondary in St. John Paul II College Gulu and then moved and finished from Pagirinya Secondary School in Pagirinya Refugee Settlement found in Adjumani, Uganda. And in the communities I've socialized with, I'm best known for writing poems, motivational speeches, and public awareness on matters affecting the societies. Since the Refugee were moved into Pagirinya Refugee Settlement, I've been moving to different communities with the Youth Empowerment Foundations and by these, I've learnt alot but the biggest of all remains the 2020 ASKnet online collaboration on documentation using github which surely will help me in my writing journey and also the organization or groups I will work with in the nearby future.

However, the most interesting part of me that most people don't know and don't realize is that I'm so sensitive to matters that concern me and my communities of intervention of the organization I have moved with. But still all in all, I want the world to know that; 
- **We are in a world**
- **Where the poor**
- **hate the poor**
- **Where the rich**
- **hate the poor**
- **Where the poor**
- **exploit the poor**
- **Where the rich**
- **exploit the poor**
- **Where the poor**
- **get only poorer**
- **for the rich**
- **to be richer**
- **Where the world**
- **oppress the poor**
- **and the poor**
- **oppress the soil**
- **where the poor blood**
- **count more than his sweat**
- **Where the poor**
- **would trade with a caged bird**
- **Where the poor**
- **is enslaved generation wise**
- **Where a poor**
- **meet his waterloo**
- **for a big dream.**

This is what I see in my world, So let's not back from empowering the vulnerable communities, for they need alot of support from us. Thanks.
