Hello! I am a Communications Specialist from Adjumani District, Uganda. I have five years experience in Journalism and Public Relations having worked In media and government institutions. Currently, I have been a part of Content Development at the Youth Empowerment Foundation since 2018.

My love for journalism dates back to my school days. I went to Hormisdallen Primary School, Our Lady of Good Counsel, Gayaza for my O'Level, Gombe Secondary School for my A'level, Makerere University for my Bachelors' Degree in Journalism and Uganda Management Institute for my Post Graduate Diploma in Journalism. I participated in Music, Dance and Drama in every school I went to. While everyone else, probably majority of the students used the library for research and further reading, I used it for reading novels. In fact, I used to save my pocket money for buy small pocket radios just to listen to particularly news. This passion led me to the News Room not just as a Anchor but an Editor. Apart from doing Content Development in Youth Empowerment Foundation, I am also part of the same department at ,an all girls' CBO based in Adjumani dubbed; Train A Girl, Uganda. I have also written and directed the documentation of success stories for other NGOs like EMESCO Development Foundation, Adjumani District Local Government, UNHCR and World Vision. When I made 28 years in April 2021, I though it was the perfect moment to start a mentorship program for Journalists in Adjumani dubbed; Media4All. With this I hope to not just share my skills but learn from those with a like mind.
