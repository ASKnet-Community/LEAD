Dut is a talented and self-taught web designer and software engineer based in Adjumani, Uganda. He has a strong background in using open source tools and frameworks and has honed his skills through self-study and experimentation. Dut's passion for technology was sparked at a young age when he discovered the joy of programming through games like "Need for Speed." At the age of 14, he taught himself Python and has since continued to expand his skillset, becoming proficient in web design and programming. Despite the challenges of being a refugee, Dut has shown determination and a drive to continuously improve his skills. He is a quick-thinking, self-motivated individual who leverages the support of his community to shape his own path.
