I am a highly motivated individual with a diploma in computer science, committed to making a positive impact in the lives of refugees. With several years of experience in training and development, I have successfully leveraged my skills and knowledge to equip refugees with the necessary computer skills and knowledge they need to succeed in today's digital world.

My work at the YEF organization in the refugee camp has given me the opportunity to use my expertise in ICT to train and mentor refugees. Through interactive and engaging training sessions, I have been able to provide refugees with the tools they need to harness the power of technology to transform their lives.

My passion for working with refugees stems from a desire to empower them to rebuild their lives and create a brighter future for themselves and their families. With my strong communication skills, I have been able to build strong relationships with refugees from diverse backgrounds, ensuring that they receive personalized support and guidance.

I am committed to continuous professional development and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in the field of ICT. This has enabled me to design and deliver innovative training programs that are tailored to the unique needs of refugees.

If you are seeking a dedicated and knowledgeable ICT Trainer to join your team, I believe that my experience and expertise make me an ideal candidate. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your organization's mission of empowering refugees through ICT training.
