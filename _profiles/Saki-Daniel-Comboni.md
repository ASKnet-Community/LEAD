My name is saki Daniel comboni, a south sudanese residing in Adjumani district in Uganda. I am one of the founders of The Youth Empowerment Foundation which started in 2017 working as a financial administrative Executive. I posses a bachelor's degree in business and management majoring in finance, diploma in accountancy, and a certificate in administrative law leading to a substantial contribution to my management and business skills such as team work, administration and financial management.

The foundation is a platform in place that supports youth difficulties as well as building up their skills, we intend to create a community with the proficiency of business, technology and media which help them commence their careers.
