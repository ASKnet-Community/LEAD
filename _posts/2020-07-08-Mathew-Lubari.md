Hello world,
My name is Matthew Lubari a South Sudanese by Nationality born in Yei in October 16th, 1991 in a small village called Jombu and Diploma Holder in Infromation Tectnology from the Internation al University of East Africa - Uganda
I grew up in South Sudan but most of my time spent in Uganda at school. But in 2016 I came to Uganda as a refugee due to the conflict and I got registered in Bibibidi settlement where I started volunteering with RMF, Action Against Hunger and MSF France – in Uganda as a Community Informant supporting in community mobilization of PSNs and data collection and analysis services before I moved to CTEN where my profession lies.

Technology is my passion, I started it when I was still in senior 3 in 2008. that was the time I accessed a mobile phone an the funny thing was when my friend used to tease to open the phone lock yet I didn’t know.
I am a highly resourceful, reasonably flexible, innovative, and enthusiastic IT personnel with a Diploma in Information Technology from the University of East Africa. I am a quick learner who can absorb new ideas and is experienced in provision of computer hardware and software support, as well as conducting ICT skills training. I am a well-organized and excellent team player with proven ability to work proactively in a complex and busy office environment.

Currently I am working for Community Technology Empowerment Network(CTEN) as a Project Manager I started as a volunteering in the ICT department tasked with the role of managing all the innovation centers in Rhino Camp and Bidi Bidi. Before joining CTEN in 2017, I volunteered with RMF, Action Against Hunger and MSF France – in Uganda as a Community Informant supporting in community mobilization of PSNs and data collection and analysis services.
